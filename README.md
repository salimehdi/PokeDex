# React + Vite PokeApi based project

This is a pokeApi based project which uses the 
- name
- weight
- height
- power
- spirit
to showcase each and every pokemon minimalistically .

There a option of next and previous in the response of API which helped me to make a prev and next button at the bottom of the page
